# MyReads Project

This is the MyReads- A Book Lending App final project for the Udacity React Fundamentals course.

To run the project do:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

This will open up a browser window and connect to http://localhost:4000. The main page will show 3 book shelves with some books in each of the shelves.

You can search and add books to the shelves by clicking on the search button ('+') at the bottom right of the main page.

As you type into the search box, the books matching the search will appear below. You can add the books from the search results to any of the book shelf.  Once you select a book, they will disappear from the search results page and moved to the selected bookshelf.

The main page can be refreshed any number of times and it will show the book selections on the 3 shelves.

Important: The search terms are limited to the [SEARCH_TERMS.md] so not all searches will yield results.  Also, the search results are limited to 25 books for all of the search terms.
